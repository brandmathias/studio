/**
 * @fileOverview This file is now a placeholder. The logic has been moved to 
 * src/ai/flows/create-calendar-event-flow.ts to resolve a 'use server' module boundary error.
 * In a real-world scenario, you might have separate tool files, but they cannot be
 * imported directly into other 'use server' files if they export non-function objects.
